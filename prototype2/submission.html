	<h4>ART</h4>
	
        Art submissions are held in Haas Fine Arts Center in room 301. You are allowed to submit up to five works of any medium. If you cannot attend but would like to submit, contact <b>art.NOTA@uwec.edu.</b><br><br>
		
        The first half of the event is dedicated to submissions while the second is dedicated to voting. If you arrive late, your piece may be at a disadvantage if voting has already started. Everyone is welcome to vote, even if you did not submit work. You are asked to vote for your top 10 choices. All votes will be counted at the end of the night. The top 20-25 pieces will be included in the issue.<br><br>

        Work can be picked up the following day in the sculpture storage room on the first floor next to the Art & Design Department Office. Work that is left in the storage room should be left untouched unless you are the artist that created it. Please pick up work as quickly as possible following submissions for its safety. Email questions to<br> <b>art.NOTA@uwec.edu</b>
