        Homework extends study beyond the school day. It reinforces what children learn in school and allows them to practice, review, reflect and make new meaning. In this way, homework allows for deeper learning and a better overall education. Homework can also improve time management skills, organizational skills, study and research skills, self-discipline and concentration, create good habits including reading for pleasure. These are all independent life skills that will help a student in every aspect of their lives for the rest of their lives. Also, in some cases, homework might be life changing. It can keep students out of trouble by giving them less time to make bad choices such as even joining gangs or getting involved with drugs or mischief.

        Homework is time consuming and it takes up all children's playtime! Imagine this. You come home from a big day at school and guess who's going to greet you home! IT'S HOMEWORK!!! Some children spend 4-6 hours on homework and assignments sometimes! That’s what happened to me 38 years ago! It can affect kids’ health if done for more than 2 hours. It can also prevent family time and makes parents feel like this is a daily stress routine. Last it does not improve grades. If you know how to do it, why have to do extra? It doesn't make sense.

        Homework gives an opportunity for parents to be involved with their children’s learning, often becoming additional “teachers”. It gives them the opportunity to bond on projects, share ideas, read together and share work ethics. Many parents value the chance to see what their child is studying. They can keep up to date with their child’s grades and abilities and then be advocates for their kids and support them. If parents are involved and feel positive about their child’s education, they will be more likely to support the school community including the school’s budget.
