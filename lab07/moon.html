                The moon is not a planet, but a satellite of the Earth.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                The surface area of the moon is 14,658,000 square miles or 9.4 billion acres   
            </li>
        
            <li>
        
                Only 59% of the moon's surface is visible from earth.    
            </li>
        
            <li>
                The moon rotates at 10 miles per hour compared to the earth's rotation of 1000 miles per hour.    
            </li>
        
            <li>
                When a month has two full moons, the second full moon is called a blue moon. Another definition of a blue moon is the third full moon in any season (quarter of year) containing 4 total full moons.    
            </li>
        
            <li>
                From Earth, we always see the same side of the moon; the other side is always hidden.   
            </li>
        
            <li>
                The dark spots we see on the moon that create the image of the man in the moon are actually craters filled with basalt, which is a very dense material.
