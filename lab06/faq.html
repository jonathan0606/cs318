    <h3>In what grade does a girl have to be to start camping?</h3>
    
    <p class="answer">
        There is no set age for camping, just a need for individual and troop/group readiness for the experience. Before going into an unknown situation, girls should feel comfortable staying away from home one or two nights. Try a sleepover first. If a girl has never been to camp before, she should spend some time learning skills needed in an outdoor environment.

    <h3>What does ACA accreditation mean?</h3>
    
    <p class="answer">
        Girl Scout councils can choose to belong to the American Camp Association (ACA). ACA accreditation means that the camp practices have been measured against national standards and go a step beyond a state's basic licensing requirements. However, all Girl Scout camps are given activity and program recommendations and standards through Girl Scouts of the USA. Councils are encouraged to belong to ACA, but membership and accreditation are not required as there are additional fees involved.

    <h3>What if you are nervous about attending camp?</h3>
    
    <p class="answer">
        Many girls get scared or nervous before attending their first day at camp, whether it's day camp or overnight camp. To help you feel more comfortable, perhaps before camp opens you could visit the day camp site to become familiar with things. You might also see if you could talk with the camp director to learn more about the program. She or he could answer any of your questions. Finally, see if there is someone you know who is attending camp; you could have a buddy on the first day.

    <h3> Do volunteers get to go to summer camp with their group?</h3>
    
    <p class="answer">
    Generally, leaders/advisors do not attend resident camp with their girls. However, they do attend troop/group camp or core staff camp, where they stay with their troop/group and work with a core staff who offers activities. The staff/volunteers running the core staff camp experience usually provide all the logistical arrangements such as food, project supplies, and experienced instructors when needed.
